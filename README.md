This repository shows how to simulation of the Wrightâ€“Fisher Model (genetic drift) and plot the Hardy-Weinberg principle. 

## Structure of the project

If the folder structure is not created, you should run the `0.initialize.R` script which will install and load all libraries, create the folder structure and print the session info for R (version of packages and `R`).
